# Personal Website

This is the code for my personal website: a project I built to deepen my understanding of React while learning Tailwind CSS, CI/CD, Git version control, and other modern tools. It serves as a portfolio to showcase the projects Iâ€™m working on and share a bit about how I got into programming in the first place.

Feel free to poke around â€” you might even uncover an easter egg or two!
